The growth of 5G and beyond has increased demand for the finite radio frequency spectrum. Traditional static management is inefficient, leading to a paradox where spectrum is both scarce and underutilized. Dynamic spectrum sharing is a viable solution, but it requires accurate, real-time insight into spectrum occupancy. This necessitates detailed spectrogram analysis to precisely define the boundaries of superimposed signals - like 5G, LTE, and radar - even when faced with noise and channel degradation. We propose a novel, lightweight, and efficient deep learning architecture. It converts radio frequency waveforms into spectrograms using the short-time Fourier transform. The architecture integrates three modules: Asymmetric Dilated Attention Convolution for multi-scale features, Selective Scan Channel Attention for long-range dependencies, and Multi-Scale Adaptive Fusion for information integration. The model achieves SOTA performance with 99.04% total accuracy and 96.66% average intersection over union. This is accomplished with a highly efficient architecture of only 1.25M parameters and an 11.41 ms inference latency. These results demonstrate an excellent balance between precision and efficiency, coupled with significant robustness against practical channel degradations.
