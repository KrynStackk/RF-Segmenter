The proliferation of 5G technology and its successors has driven an increased demand for the finite radio frequency spectrum. Conventional static management practices have proven inefficient, resulting in a paradoxical situation where spectrum resources are perceived as both limited and underutilized. Dynamic spectrum sharing presents a promising solution; however, it necessitates precise and real-time insights into spectrum occupancy. This requirement underscores the importance of conducting detailed spectrogram analyses to accurately delineate the boundaries of overlapping signals, such as those generated by 5G, LTE, and radar, even amidst the challenges posed by noise and channel degradation.

In this context, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and efficient deep learning architecture designed to convert radio frequency waveforms into spectrograms through the application of the short-time Fourier transform. Our proposed architecture comprises three integral modules: Asymmetric Dilated Attention Convolution to capture multi-scale features, Selective Scan Channel Attention to address long-range dependencies, and Multi-Scale Adaptive Fusion to facilitate the integration of information. The model demonstrates remarkable efficacy, achieving state-of-the-art performance metrics, including a total accuracy of 99.04% and an average intersection over union of 96.66%. Notably, this performance is achieved with an architecture characterized by only 1.25 million parameters and an inference latency of 11.41 ms. These results exemplify a commendable equilibrium between precision and efficiency, while also showcasing significant resilience against practical channel degradation challenges.
